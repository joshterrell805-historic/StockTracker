The goal of this app is to record stock data for the next 10 or so months while I am in school.

While in school I will study up on machine learning and then use the data I've collected to automatically buy and sell stocks in a profitable manner.

I think most people involved in stocks are a bit involved in the news. My assumption is that the news and other data sites influence people in a causal manner when it comes to buying and selling stocks. Also the past stock prices impact the way people buy and sell stocks.

This tool is focused on larger companies, not penny stocks. Another separate tool should be constructed for penny stocks.

#### Data to Record

   - per item: title, description, timestamp, author, link
   - text of articles linked to from rss feeds
      - not all articles, just some of the feeds/articles.. maybe a random sample? maybe only select sources?

#### Revision 1

I'm only going to have enough time to get RSS feeds and stock data working, however I'm fairly certain that's more than enough data. The possibilities with this amount of data are vast, and I'm fairly certain that if there is correlation between stocks and news, RSS feeds should depict it.

Originally I was going to scrape websites for info too (with formats other than RSS).
