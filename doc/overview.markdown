The goal of this app is to record stock data for the next 10 or so months while I am in school.

While in school I will study up on machine learning and then use the data I've collected to automatically buy and sell stocks in a profitable manner.

I think most people involved in stocks are a bit involved in the news. My assumption is that the news and other data sites influence people in a causal manner when it comes to buying and selling stocks. Also the past stock prices impact the way people buy and sell stocks.

This tool is focused on larger companies, not penny stocks. Another separate tool should be constructed for penny stocks.
