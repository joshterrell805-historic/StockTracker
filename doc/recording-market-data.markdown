# Recording Market Data

### Record
1. Record all data possible (with discrimination on stupid fields) about selected stocks.
  - Every X minutes
  - Save all to datafile in using timestamp in name.
2. Record all data possible about major stock-indexes.
  - Included in same file?

TODO: select the stocks to record.

### Transfer to long-term storage
Just like the rss feeds, I flush all the recorded data to the backup server every day or so.
